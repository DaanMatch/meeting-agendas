## Agenda

### Team

Now that you're all experts in DT we can start moving much faster. :)
We are defining the "problem space" we're building  solutions for.

Please take *30 minutes BEFORE Tuesday* to do Prework
Our second session wil focus on Impacts (and  impact measurement), People, and Challenges

Use the [direct mural link](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/aistrategiesaisi4575/1655216143233?sender=uac26daba786dda4103066357&key=0035a6a7-e1ec-4bcf-9fd0-c5ba9078528e) to see and work on the mural prior to Tuesday
On Tuesday, Use [zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/85424693863?pwd=cWU0MTE4TnQwanZ2eXQrQ3FxOUs1QT09) login to get our voices in the discussion.

I cleaned up the Vision statement based on the [ppt vision](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iwab1zoaST0URPnBQp9fzB2vbySUfiZ3JgK-bawTgmk/edit#slide=id.g133867ed1a9_0_0) I sent out after last Tuesday's  session. I also am preserving the team's yellow stickies with dotted lines pointing to the vision  outline you saw in my presentation.  There's also a group of our stickie Un assigned on the right.

Please review for a sanity test and feel free to change any objectionable wording by adding a new stickie we can compare to the old one.  

We'll review Vision on zoom Tuesday before going to the other areas

### Prework

#### Impact

Please use the yellow stickies next to the Impact section to brainstorm impacts  and impact measurement.  per the canvas instructions:

Have we agreed upon measures of success?
Specify how we will measure and report impact.

If we have any agreed measures of success but don't have Vision statement that cover them, Please add a yellow stickie placeholder so we can also revisit it on Tuesday
Please make a guesses if you don't know what measures of success we can use.

#### People

Copy blank yellow stickies from the Impact blank group to avoid different sizes being used
YOU CAN'T GAIN PRIORITY WITH BIGGer BOXES:)

Begin to list ANY user audiences and stakeholders as follows

Have we identified all the individuals who may influence the creation, delivery, and use of the solution we develop?
Highlight the most important stakeholders and articulate their needs, goals, and/or motivations.

#### Challenges

Have we identified what might prevent us from achieving our vision?
List our key enablers, obstacles, and areas of opportunity.

Thanks!
Alan
