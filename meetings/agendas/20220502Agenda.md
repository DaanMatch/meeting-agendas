I asked Michael Koegel to try to squeeze us into his schedule and to officially join the advisory board. Heâ€™s actually our first advisory from Cal, so hope heâ€™ll come on.


Also asked Sukhendra Rompally of Chezuba to officially represent on the advisory board. Not expecting a yes but heâ€™s a good friend to us.
