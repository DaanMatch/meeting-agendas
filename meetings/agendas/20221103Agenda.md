## 2. Discussion

**Backing up**
With passwordless SSH connections, you can send commands via SFTP. Two commands that can be run from any automation. 
Better without users. Kenneth will write the script. Patrick's role is to check it at an interval.

```
ssh -i FieldWorker.pem fieldworker.daanmatch.com
```
