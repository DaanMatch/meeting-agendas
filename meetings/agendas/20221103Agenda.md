## 1. Call to Order

- Kenneth Kron - kronsensei@gmail.com

## 2. Discussion

**Backing up**
With passwordless SSH connections, you can send commands via SFTP. Two commands that can be run from any automation. 
Better without users. Kenneth will write the script. Patrick's role is to check it at an interval.

Need to chmod 600 .pem file (and folder).

To connect to SSH:
```
ssh -i FieldWorker.pem ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

To get tgz files:
```
scp -i FieldWorker.pem ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/var/www/flask/backup.tgz .
```

Images are in static/uploads_fieldworker, but had to rename file extension to .jpg (.png also works).

As backup gets larger and larger, we decided to use rsync to only download the difference. But need to have a backup, just incase rsync is corrupt.
