## 2. Add on to questions made by Jaideep + Carla

Shayeka is targeting NGOs that we are already communicating. Screen the NGOs to see whether they would fit into our model. Find a few non-profits that will immediately fit into our project. E.g. do they have a website, are they doing a programme such as a distribution project that our app can track, do they have the paperwork in place?

Request for rest of DaanMatch team to reveiw and add questions.

Action Item: Convert spreadsheet to Form.
