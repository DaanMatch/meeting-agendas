## 1. Call to Order

- Patrick Guo - guopatrick.comping@gmail.com
- Kenneth Kron - kronsensei@gmail.com
- Cara Foss Arellano - cara.arellano@berkeley.edu

## 2. Discussion

Proposed to have a pilot program. Decisions are done early in the year (latest March).
Deadline by December, to get enough data to show them in February.

Patrick assigned as project manager to manage Cara on the following projects.

- UX/UI (Creating the screens) + Wireframes

Kenneth proposes Cara create a storyboard.

Everyone wants an Android app. When CRM is filled in, Cara asks what phone/system they use, so that we can support them.
