Alan is surveying 2 morning times work to introduce Design Thinking Methodology using [Mural.co](http://mural.co/) as a collaboration tool for Virtual meetings. 1 to 1.5 hours.

- First option is Friday June 10, 2022 at 7:30am Pacific Time.
- Second is Tuesday June 14, 2022 at 7:30am.

Please let Alan know 1st choice AND 2nd choice (if you’re available for both).

 1. Basic intro to Design Thinking
 2. Online Mural session where everyone can learn and practice some really easy ways to collaborate. Creating post-its on a topic for example or divergent brainstorming where any idea is ok to suggest and convergent teaming where we take brainstorming ideas or research /tech insights and narrow down to what’s practical and a priority.
